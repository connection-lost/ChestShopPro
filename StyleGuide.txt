ChestShopPro is a plugin based on Bukkit/Spigot, this project will follow Bukkit's style guide. Due to the fact that Bukkit's style guide is no longer available, here is a basic explnation about how the style guide should be:

1. Style should follow Google Java Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
2. Exception: All variables are lowercase instead of lowerCamelCase. For instance:
    int timeplayed = 10;
    String hismessage = "xxxx";
3. Exception: Use tabs for indentation. Tab length should count as 4 spaces.
